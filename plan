1. understand the code structure

2. possible improvements: 
    - add a loading animation between jokes in case of slow computers/bad internet 
    - choose the genre of jokes (if api allows)
    - make it accessible by adding aria labels
    - retrieve jokes from api
    - limitation: only a few
 
3. get api url - https://icanhazdadjoke.com/

4. fetch api 

5. get json response

6. see what the response looks like by console.logging it

7. check differences: make sure it can match what we already have - e.g. an id and a joke (to keep as simple as possible)

8. check if we can use our random index?

9. check how it will alter the existing functions?

10. check if it updates on the DOM

11. test if pressing button generates a new joke
